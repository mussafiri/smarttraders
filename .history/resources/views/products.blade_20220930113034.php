<h3><a href="#">Real Estate Investent Law</a></h3>
<p>An investor selects a range of real estate assets from different locations of our real estate with a payment plan that is aligned with our investment returns, ranging from 15% to 32.27% annual return. 
</p> <p>This makes an investor own real estate with minimal risk as he uses the profit generated from our trading to buy the asset/process mortgage while keeping the principle intact in trading, which at the end of the contract is returned.

<h3><a href="#">Trade Managed Account</a></h3>
<p>We help you open your trading account with our partner trading brokers. You would then sign a limited power of attorney that will allow us to only trade on your behalf. The profit generated is shared - 60% would be allocated to you and 40% to our company as your traders. 
That is what we do at Smart Traders, we have helped many people build a strong financial base that is much more than what they expected.
</p> <p>Our clients, and the people they serve, are saving for a better future, retirement, paying for their childrenâ€™s education, buying homes, and starting businesses. Their investments also help to strengthen the global economy: support businesses (small and large); finance infrastructure projects that connect and power cities, and facilitate innovations that drive progress.
