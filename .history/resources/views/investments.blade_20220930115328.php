    <div><p>We use an innovative approach to diversifying our portfolio and creating sustainable income for our investors. With our team of professional traders and financial analysts, we help clients to avoid the risks of trading themselves and avoiding the risk of locking their capital in one asset class, instead they gain both returns from trading and real estate as their principal remains intact to be returned at the end of their contract.</p>
    <p>We speculate on major markets based on the effects of global trades and the performance of big businesses. When clients invest with us, they can rest assured that their capital will generate sustainable income in the long term to meet their goals.</p>
    <p><strong>Our diversification of investment is based on a range of financial markets such as shares, indices, commodities, treasuries, ETFs and currencies traded worldwide.</strong></p></div>

    <h3><a href="practice.html#">Stocks</a></h3>
    <p> Stocks or equities refer to partial ownership of a company’s assets and profits. If you own a stock of a particular company, you are entitled to a proportional share of its profits. Stocks of companies can be bought and sold in stock markets, such as the New York Stock Exchange. 
    We trade the stock prices of some of the world's largest companies and most famous brands and access stock markets from around the world, taking advantage of rising and falling stock prices.

    <h3><a href="practice.html#">Commodities</a></h3>
    <p>Commodities are another tradeable asset, like stocks, bonds, or options.
    In physical form, they are goods, usually raw and unprocessed, that come from the earth, and are used to make things that we use or consume every day.
    </p>
    <p>Commodities come in several different forms.  Soft commodities include sugar and coffee.  Grains, come in the form of rice, wheat and soybeans.  Hard commodities, or "metals" like gold and silver, are mined or extracted.  Energy commodities, like crude oil, natural gas, and electricity are the most active around the world.  Other commodity examples include live cattle, lumber/wood and dairy products.</p>
    <p> We speculate on the prices of precious metals, energies and agriculture where global events shape demand and supply or speculators look to manage their risks.</p>

    <h3><a href="practice.html#">Treasuries</a></h3>
    <p>Treasury securities are one of the safest investments as they are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. Treasury securities are divided into three primary categories according to the length of maturity. These are Treasury Bills, Treasury Bonds, and Treasury Notes.</p>
    <p>U.S. Treasuries are issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury on behalf of the federal government. They carry the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, making them a safe and popular investment. As they are considered to have low credit or default risk, they generally offer lower yields relative to other bonds.</p>

    <h3><a href="practice.html#">EFTs</a></h3>
    <p>ETFs are created and managed by financial institutions that buy and hold currencies in a fund. They then offer shares of the fund to the public on an exchange allowing you to buy and trade these shares just like stocks.</p>
    <p>Like currency options, the limitation in trading currency ETFs is that the market isn’t open 24 hours. Also, ETFs are subject to trading commissions and other transaction costs.</p>
